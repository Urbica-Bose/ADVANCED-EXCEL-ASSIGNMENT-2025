Streaming Service User Insights :- 
Welcome to my very first data analysis project!!!! This project focuses on understanding user behavior and engagement for a fictional streaming service platform using a rich dataset of 1,000 users.

What This Project Is About? 


I explored a dataset that includes detailed information about user activity, preferences, and demographics on a streaming platform. The data spans across 23 different attributes such as:
Subscription details (Monthly Price, Membership Status)
Viewing habits (Watch Hours, Favorite Genre, Primary Watch Time)
Device usage and profiles
Parental controls and content download behavior
User engagement metrics (Total Movies/Series Watched, Recommended Content Count, Ratings)
Demographics (Age Group, Country, Language Preference)
Loyalty indicators (Loyalty Points, First Device Used)

What I Did? 


As a first-time analyst, here’s what I worked on:
✅ Explored and cleaned the data
✅ Understood how different user behaviors relate to each other
✅ Looked for patterns in watch time, genre preference, and engagement
✅ Got curious about loyalty and how active users really are
✅ Compared user profiles across different age groups and devices
✅ Identified features that might drive user satisfaction and retention
✅ Created Visuals and charts to show insights clearly and prepared a dashboard for displaying the same. 
✅I have shared user segmentation and possible recommendations for product strategy.
✅ I have explored predictive trends such as which users are likely to churn.
